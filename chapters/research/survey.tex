\section{User Survey}
At the end of December 2014, an online questionnaire was distributed amongst the students of \gls{mu}. Table \ref{table:survey-faculty} illustrates the distribution of the respondents across the faculties of \gls{mu} according to the claims of the respondents. It should be noted that several respondents claimed to be studying at more than one faculty of \gls{mu}, which is the reason for the distortion of the percentage. The raw data obtained from the questionnaire in Czech is available in the \texttt{survey/survey.csv} file distributed alongside this thesis.

\begin{table}
  \caption{The distribution of the questionnaire respondents across the faculties of \acrshort{mu}}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{Xcr}
    \textbf{On which faculty of \gls{mu} do you study?} & \textbf{\#} & \textbf{\%} \\

    Faculty of Education                    &  $2$          &  $2.2$ \\

\end{table}

The overwhelming majority of respondents claimed that the highest degree for which they were studying was that of a bachelor (see Table \ref{table:survey-type}) and that they were planning to use \gls{tex} to write their theses (see Table \ref{table:survey-sw}). Most of those who claimed to be planning to use \gls{tex} also claimed to know about the existence of the fithesis \gls{docclass} and claimed to be planning to use it as a template for their theses (see Table \ref{table:survey-tex}).

    Yes                                         & $47$          & $72.3$ \\
    Maybe, I did not know it existed            & $10$          & $15.4$ \\

\end{table}

Some of the respondents who claimed to be using or planning to use \gls{tex} to typeset their theses also provided feedback regarding the fithesis class. Unknown to the author at the time of the survey was the fact that fithesis2 had never been made publicly available, despite the fact that works on fithesis2 were brought to a successful end during 2009 \cite{Filipcik09}. As a result of that, much of the feedback was regarding issues long fixed in fithesis2, such as requests for the change of the default \gls{charenc} from ISO 8859-2 to UTF-8 \cite[section~4.1]{Filipcik09} or bug reports regarding a missing metafont logo file \cite{fithesis2@fbd7a25}. Among the feedback relevant to fithesis2 were calls for a more extensive user and technical documentation\pending{} and a suggestion that the class should support the typesetting of printed and electronic versions of theses as separate documents\pending{}.
