graphics with it. For more information, see \cite{psspec}}

\longnewglossaryentry{charenc}{
  name={character encoding},
  description={A character encoding specifies how characters are
  going to be represented on the low level. The first character
  encoding in use was \gls{ascii}, which was standardized in 1963
  and which encodes lowercase and uppercase letters of English
  alphabet, digits, punctuation, a space and several teletype
  control codes. \gls{ascii} encodes each character as a 7bit
  string.\vskip\parskip\hskip\parindent As time went on, a plathora
  of 8-bit encodings, which remained backwards compatible with
  \gls{ascii}, but used the additional bit to support the encoding
  of various non-English alphabet characters, became increasingly
  popular. In the Central Europe, the encodings of choice were ISO
  8859-2 \cite{isolatin2} and Windows-1250. Character encodings
  allowed for easy text processing, as each character was exactly
  one byte long, but also introducted additional complexity when
  dealing with documents, which contained characters from several
  non-English alphabets at once.\vskip\parskip\hskip\parindent
  Nowadays, the most commonly used encoding is UTF-8
  \cite{rfc3629}, which can encode any character present in the
  Unicode character table \cite{unicode6}. This comes at the cost
  of producing variable-length characters, which introduces
  additional overhead to the text processing, although this
  overhead is generally regarded as trivial}
