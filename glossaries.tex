\newdualentry{mime}{MIME-type}{Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions Type}{
  One of the several ways to identify the type of content inside a file. As its name suggest, it was originally designed as an extension to the e-mail protocol \cite{rfc2045,rfc2046,rfc2047,rfc6838,rfc4289,rfc2049} that would allow the transfer of kinds of data other than \gls{ascii}, such as multimedia and binary files.

\newglossaryentry{hypothesis}{
  name = hypothesis,
  description = {With significance testing, we have two orthogonal hypotheses: the zero hypothesis $f(\ldots)=c$ and the alternative hypothesis $f(\ldots)\not=c$, where $f(\ldots)$ is a function of the statistics of the random variables under scrutiny and $c\in\mathbb{R}$. The hypotheses can then be tested at various significance levels. The higher the significance level, the higher the probability of refusing the zero hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, but the higher is also the risk of error}

The first character encoding in use was \gls{ascii}, which was standardized in 1963 and which encodes lowercase and uppercase letters of english alphabet, digits, punctuation, a space and several teletype control codes. \gls{ascii} encodes each character as a 7bit string.\vskip\parskip\hskip\parindent As time went on, a plathora of 8-bit encodings, which remained backwards compatible with \gls{ascii}, but used the additional bit to support the encoding of various non-english alphabet characters, became increasingly popular. In the Central Europe, the encodings of choice were ISO 8859-2 \cite{isolatin2} and Windows-1250. Character encodings allowed for easy text processing, as each character was exactly one byte long, but also introducted additional complexity when dealing with documents, which contained characters from several non-english alphabets at once.\vskip\parskip\hskip\parindent Nowadays, the most commonly used encoding is UTF-8 \cite{rfc3629}, which can encode any character present in the Unicode character table \cite{unicode6}. This comes at the cost of producing variable-length characters, which introduces additional overhead to the text processing, although this overhead is generally regarded as trivial}
